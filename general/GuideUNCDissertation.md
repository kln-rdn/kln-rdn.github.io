# Introduction
This page is being created to collect useful resources for writing the dissertation. It is being written with the needs of UNC-Chapel Hill's Nutrition doctoral students in mind.

# UNC Guides
UNC and its entities provide a few guides of interest, which should be referenced and followed. All of them apply (presuming you are in the NUTR department at UNC-CH), and so read each of them.

* [Thesis and Dissertation Guide](https://gradschool.unc.edu/academics/thesis-diss/guide/) from the Graduate School - "The Big One", a very particular and in-depth discussion of how everything should be formatted and put together in the final dissertation.
  
* NUTR Doctoral Program Handbook - The department's handbook will contain a chapter on the dissertation, which will describe the basic requirements and format, outlining the most important expectations of the *contents* of the dissertation (as opposed to the Graduate School's guide above, which is more focused on formatting).   Each year the handbook is revised and republished, so consult *your year's* handbook.
  
* [Dissertation Boot Camps](https://writingcenter.unc.edu/dissertation-boot-camp/) are held usually once per semester, hosted by the Writing Center. They often will offer a virtual version as well; these are not "instructional" for how to create the dissertation, but are dedicated times to write with support and encouragement.
  
* [Thesis and Dissertation Resources](https://gradschool.unc.edu/academics/thesis-diss/) from the Graduate School - Includes more information and resources from the graduate school, including recorded formatting workshops found on YT. Direct links to the recordings are below. Note that during this workshopthe "audience" is following along with documents they had been provided. I've reached out to the host of the workshop, [Dr. Patrick Brandt](https://bbsp.unc.edu/employee/patrick-brandt-phd/), in order to obtain the template files below.

## Dr. Brandt's Guides
[Download Dr. Brandt's template file here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lUChtOekQ0fq2fXfCCZvAKGX2noFaq3Y/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=113231950692894093702&rtpof=true&sd=true)

### Landscape Page Numbers
1. Add a section break at the bottom of the page before the page you want to rotate. (“Page Layout” > “Breaks” > “Section Break - next page”)
2. Add a section break at the bottom of the page that will be turned.  
3. If page numbering starts back at “1” after inserting section breaks, format page numbering to “continue from previous section”. This is done while in “footer view” > page number > format page number > “continue from previous section”
4. While still in footer view on the page that will be turned deselect “different first page”
5. Then deselect “link to previous” under the “header and footer tools” design tab. Go to the header of the same page and deselect “link to previous section” also.
6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 on the first page after the rotated page.  
7. Delete the page number found on the page that will be turned.  
8. With the cursor on the page you want to rotate, in the “File” > “Page Layout” dialog box, change the orientation to landscape. Check to make sure that only the intended page(s) have turned and that the numbering before and after the turned page is correct.
9. Within the footer of the rotated page, click on “page number > “Page margins” > Plain number, border, left”. This will create a text box with the page number on the left center margin.
10. Select the text box, which probably has a bottom border attached to it. Remove the bottom border under the “Home” tab > borders > “no border”
11. Click the Text Direction button in the Drawing Tools” Format tab. Then rotate the number 90 degrees clockwise.  
12. You may have to manually move the text box to the center of the left margin such that the number is 0.5 inches from the edge of the paper. 
13. Confirm that page numbering in previous and subsequent sections look OK.
14. Done this way, all page numbers will automatically update if pages are added or removed before the rotated page

### Updating Table of Contents
#### **Creating the Table of Contents**
1. Use heading styles to mark text that you want to appear in the Table of Contents. By default use “Heading 1” for Chapter Title, “Heading 2” for sub sections of each chapter.
2. Place the cursor where you want the TOC to appear
3. Under the “References” tab, click on “Table of Contents” then “Insert Table of Contents…”, (Don’t use the Automatic Tables that come up as options.)
	1. Select “show page numbers”
	2. Select dots as the tab leader
	3. Under “Formats”, select “From Template”
	4. Choose the number of levels you desire
	5. Click “OK”
4. When updating the TOC (right click on the TOC), I suggest you always click on “update the entire table” in case you made changes to the text in any of your headings.

#### Other TOC Tips
1. The TOC should only include pages after the TOC, not page numbers before the TOC (or the TOC itself). If you used heading styles to mark text on pages before the TOC you can exclude by going to “References” > Add Text > “do not include in Table of Contents”
2. If you need to edit the TOC after it has been inserted, follow the directions in #3 as if you were inserting a TOC but instead of clicking “OK”, click on “Modify”.
3. In some cases it is possible to modify the formatting of the TOC in place. Sometimes those edits will “survive” an update of the TOC, but other times updating will undo changes you have made. For that reason it is best to use tip #2 above in my opinion.
4. TOC1, TOC2, or TOC3 correspond to the styles that are used for your primary, secondary, and tertiary levels. In other words, if you want to change the way the chapter level (primary) TOC entries appear, select TOC1 then click modify to change the font or paragraph attributes so the entries act as you would like.
5. In order to have entries that are double spaced between entries and single spaced for long entries that span more than 1 line; Under “Modify”, “Format”, “Paragraph” choose single spacing with 12 points after (or 11 if that is what your body text is).
6. If you don’t want to use Heading 1, 2, and 3 and your TOC level styles you can change the TOC levels to collect text marked with any style. To do this follow click on Table of Contents > “Insert Table of Contents” > “Options” and then select which styles you want to use to mark TOC levels 1, 2, 3, etc.
7. If the text in your TOC or your EndNote references ever looks funky, it probably means the code is displayed not the resulting text. To make everything look normal again press alt + Fn + F9 to toggle between code and normal views
8. There can only be one TOC in a document. If you need to create other lists follow the instruction below.

### Table of Tables/Figures/etc
1. “Alt” + “shift” + “O” (letter O) allows you to mark text for a list of tables. This will open the “Mark Table of Contents Entry” dialog box.  
2. If you are selecting bolded text, as is often the case with figure titles, you’ll need to un-bold it in the Mark Table of Contents Entry dialog by pressing Ctrl +B  
3. Choose a table identifier other than “C” that makes sense to you and mark all text for a given table with the same table identifier. (eg “T” for tables, “F” for figures, “E” for equations, etc).
4. Put your cursor where you want the list of tables/figures/etc to appear  
5. Under the “References” tab, “Captions” subpanel, click on “Insert Table of Figures”  
6. Under the “Options” menu, "choose the table identifier you used to identify the text. Be sure “Table Entry Fields” is checked, and add the table.  
  
#### Other tips and hints for tables of figures
1. If you forget to switch from table identifier “C” to another letter, these entries will be incorrectly added to your Table of Contents.  
2. The extra text that appears between {brackets} after marking the text will not appear in the printed document or a PDF that you generate.  
3. **Very Important**: When adding more than one “Table of Figures” you will be asked, “Do you want to replace the selected table?”. Just click “no” and all tables of figures/tables/equations/schemes/etc marked with different table identifiers will coexist in the same document.
4. If the table of figures needs to be edited (for example changed to double spacing) then you will need to modify the formatting similar to how it is explained for the TOC styles under “Other TOC tips” #2 and #4 on page 1 of this handout.

# Other Resources

The **Carolina Digital Repository** from the University Libraries houses all dissertations submitted to the university. You will likely need to log in with your ONYEN, but this is a great resource to view examples of dissertations. [At this link](https://cdr.lib.unc.edu/catalog?f%5Baffiliation_label_sim%5D%5B%5D=Department+of+Nutrition&f%5Bresource_type_sim%5D%5B%5D=Dissertation&locale=en) you can find all Nutrition doctoral dissertations submitted to the repository. You can also filter further by advisor to see dissertations from specific labs.
